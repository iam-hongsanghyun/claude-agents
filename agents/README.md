# Agents — Role Reference

All 18 agents are installed to `~/.claude/agents/` and available globally in every Claude Code session.

## Quick-pick: given task X, call agent Y

| Task | Agent |
|---|---|

| Implement a feature / write or refactor Python code | `developer` |
| React + TypeScript + Vite UI (canvas, maps, grids, charts) | `frontend-developer` |
| Mechanical build gate before review (tsc, mypy, lint, emoji scan) | `tester` |
| Judgment review of a diff: scope, duplication, contract | `reviewer` |

## Tier 1 — Workflow Orchestration

### `planner-and-qc-lead`
Plans any non-trivial task: decomposes into steps, identifies risks, produces a tailored QC checklist, routes work to the right agents. **Does not write code or research.**

---

## Tier 2 — Code: Writing & Review

### `developer`
Implements features, refactors, documents inline (docstrings). Enforces CLAUDE.md: type hints, `Algorithm:` docstring sections (LaTeX + ASCII), `uv`/`ruff`/`mypy`/`pytest`, no hardcoded values, `pint` units, reproducible seeds. Finishes the task completely, generalises over special-casing, reuses over duplicating, and verifies in the running app.
- **Not for**: React/TS UI → `frontend-developer`; research reports → `writing-support-team`; code-facing docs → `doc-writer`

### `frontend-developer`
React + TypeScript + Vite browser clients for scientific-modelling GUIs: React Flow canvases, Leaflet / d3-geo maps, Glide/TanStack data grids, hand-rolled SVG charts, resizable rails, plugin hosts. Honors the project's existing layout/interaction contract and design system, reuses CSS (no duplication, `:root` variables), keeps the backend↔frontend type contract exact, verifies in the running app, and never adds icons/emojis.
- **Not for**: Python model code → `developer`; matplotlib/plotly figures → `visualizer`

### `tester`
Mechanical build gate — no judgment. Type-check (`tsc`/`mypy`), compile, lint on a **plain** `ruff check .`, emoji/icon scan, tests. Pass/fail report. Runs *before* `reviewer` so the reviewer focuses on intent.
- **Not for**: design/scope judgment → `reviewer`

### `reviewer`
APPROVE/REJECT a diff against the one task asked for. Rejects on icons/emojis, scope creep, duplication of existing functionality, hardcoded domain data, and broken backend↔frontend contract. Read-only judgment; assumes `tester` passed first.
- **Not for**: mechanical checks → `tester`; deep math correctness → `math-reviewer`

### `math-reviewer`
Verifies that code matches the equations in `Algorithm:` docstring sections and `docs/ALGORITHM.md`. Checks discretization stability, sign conventions, indexing, tolerances, edge cases. **Read-only.**
- **Not for**: fixing code → `developer`

### `auditor`
End-to-end pre-merge review: no hardcoded values, config externalized, `pint` at boundaries, doc/code alignment, project layout, tooling clean. **Read-only.**
- **Not for**: fixing code → `developer`

### `refactor-architect`
Restructures code without changing behavior: extract functions/modules, deduplicate, reduce coupling, remove dead code. Tests stay green at every step.
- **Not for**: new features → `developer`

### `debugger`
Reproduces bugs, isolates root cause (not symptoms), proposes minimal fix. Bisects, inspects logs, traces hypotheses. Writes a failing test before fixing.
- **Not for**: new features → `developer`

---

## Tier 3 — Code: Domain Specialists

### `data-scientist`
EDA, statistical analysis, ML prototyping, experiment analysis **in code**. Verifies input/output data alignment (schemas, dtypes, units, time zones) and enforces file-format best practice (parquet > CSV for numerical data).
- **Not for**: internet research → `energy-finance-team` / `investment-asset-team`; charts → `visualizer`

### `optimization-modeller`
LP / MILP / NLP model code using PyPSA, linopy, pyomo, cvxpy. Formulation correctness, infeasibility debugging, solver tuning, duality interpretation.
- **Not for**: energy market research → `energy-finance-team`

### `gis-analyst`
Geospatial **code**: geopandas, shapely, rasterio, xarray. CRS audits (the #1 source of GIS errors), spatial-join pitfalls, raster/vector mismatches, choropleth binning.
- **Not for**: general charts for reports → `visualizer` or `writing-support-team`

### `data-collector`
Builds **reusable, tested Python pipelines** for web scraping and API ingestion (OpenDART, Yahoo Finance, KOSIS, news APIs, government open data). Polite scraping, retry/backoff, pydantic/pandera schema validation, idempotent storage.
- **Not for**: one-off research lookups → `energy-finance-team` / `investment-asset-team`; analysing already-collected data → `data-scientist`

### `visualizer`
Produces charts, maps, and dashboards **in code**: matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, folium, pydeck. Catches legend-off-canvas, log-scale zeros, twin-axis confusion, color-blind-unsafe palettes. Publication-ready figures.
- **Not for**: report narrative around a chart → `writing-support-team`

### `doc-writer`
**Code-facing documentation only**: README, CLI manuals, tutorials with runnable examples, troubleshooting guides, architecture overviews, contributor guides, CHANGELOG entries. Diátaxis-aware (tutorial / how-to / reference / explanation).
- **Not for**: research reports, memos, presentations → `writing-support-team`; inline docstrings → `developer`; energy/investment content → domain research teams

---

## Tier 4 — Research & Analysis (no code)

### `energy-finance-team`
A 4-persona research team (PLANiT Institute) delivering structured reports on energy markets, ESG, climate finance, and energy policy. Uses web search, Yahoo Finance, and DART.
- **Not for**: optimization model code → `optimization-modeller`; data pipelines → `data-collector`; investment portfolio analysis → `investment-asset-team`

### `investment-asset-team`
A 5-persona investment analysis team covering portfolio management, equity valuation, bond/credit analysis, and risk metrics. Outputs structured investment reports using Yahoo Finance, DART, and web research.
- **Not for**: energy/policy research → `energy-finance-team`; model code or data pipelines → `developer` / `data-collector`

### `writing-support-team`
A 4-persona writing team for professional documents: research reports, white papers, policy briefs, business memos, executive summaries, presentations, and technical methodology descriptions for non-code audiences.
- **Not for**: code-facing docs (README, CLI, tutorials) → `doc-writer`; domain energy/investment analysis → those teams

## Recommended workflows

### Feature development
```
planner-and-qc-lead  →  developer / frontend-developer
                     →  math-reviewer      (if math changed)
                     →  optimization-modeller (if LP/MILP changed)
                     →  data-scientist     (if data I/O changed)
                     →  visualizer         (if charts involved)
                     →  tester             (mechanical gate)
                     →  reviewer           (judgment gate, before commit)
                     →  auditor            (before merge)
```

### Bug fix
```
debugger  →  developer / frontend-developer  →  tester  →  reviewer  →  auditor
```

### Refactor
```
refactor-architect  →  auditor
```

### Research → report
```
energy-finance-team  or  investment-asset-team
→  writing-support-team   (if formal document needed)
```

### Data pipeline
```
data-collector  →  data-scientist  →  developer  (integrate into codebase)
```
